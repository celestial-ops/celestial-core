One of the goals of celestial is to improve machine utilization, in order to do that a garbage collection scheme should be implemented, couple of options come to mind:

* GC machines with low utilization over a long period of time
* GC machines that weren't accessed for a long time (will SSH time will do?)
* Study user preference and predict on top of that (a recommendation engine)
*
